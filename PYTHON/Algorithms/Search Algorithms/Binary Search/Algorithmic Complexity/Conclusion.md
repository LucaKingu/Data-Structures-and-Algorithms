The Binary search is a highly efficient algorithm, having a time complexity of Big O(log(n)) and space complexity of Big O(1). All 3 languages: Java, C++ and Python contain a built in Binary search(Bisect on Python) which I always suggest on using for their integrity. 

Conclusion:
The main differences between the Linear and binary search algorithms are as follows:
Linear > Time Complexity:Big O(n) > sequential asses of elements > both sorted and unsorted
Binary > Time Complextiy:Big O(log(n)) > "random" asses of elements > only sorted

Although Binary search seems like the obvious choice for all situations, it is not always the case. Especially in situations where data is not sorted or code simplicity is more important.
