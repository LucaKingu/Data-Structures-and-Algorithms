Bubble sort is simple to implement but consists of a time complexity of Big O(n^2) which is highly inefficient. 

It also consits of a space complexity of Big O(n) which means it requires a constant amount of space for temporary variables. 

Thus, bubble sort should not be used in industry practice.
