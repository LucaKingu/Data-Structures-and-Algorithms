The Quick Sort is considered to be one of the fastest sorting algorithms and in turn is used frequently in the industry. This is due to it having a time complexity of Big O(n log(n)) 

And a time complexity of Big O(long(n)) which is considered to be highly efficient. 

Although it is a bit complex to understand and further to implement, once you have grasped how it works and how the code plays its part then it becomes easier. The algorithm can further be optimized with randomization for the pivot.
