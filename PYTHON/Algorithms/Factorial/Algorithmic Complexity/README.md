It can be clearly seen that the Factorial Recurssion function contains a time complexity of Big O(n!). This makes it an extremely inefficient algorithm as it increases factorially, meaning as the numbers increase the computational resources required are expensive

The space complexity of the function is Big O(n) due to the space usage on the call stack growing linearly with input size.
