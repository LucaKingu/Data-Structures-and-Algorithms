This is a project based around Data structures and algorithms for myself to grasp and further improve my knowledge on the subject.
The data structures and algorithms are attempted to be implemented via 3 languages. Java, C++ and Python. This helps me to:
1. attempt the DS/A a minimum of 3 times  
2. Constantly practice the syntax and structure of 3 globally used programming languages


I also explore and understand the time and space complexities inlcuding Big O notations to determine the growth rate of a function.
On Python, I give my conclusions and also plot the graphs using matplotlib to clearly depict the Big O time complexity.
